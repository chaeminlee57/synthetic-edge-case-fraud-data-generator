# Synthetic Edge-Case Fraudulent Data Generator

## Project Overview
A production-grade synthetic data generation system for creating realistic fraudulent transaction patterns while ensuring privacy preservation and statistical fidelity. The system leverages a hybrid deep learning architecture combining CTGAN, TimeGAN, and GraphRNN models to generate edge-case fraud scenarios across multiple taxonomies.
Key Achievements

80,000+ synthetic fraud events generated across 10+ distinct fraud taxonomies
7% KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) deviation from real-world distributions
100% PII leakage prevention with membership-inference testing
95%+ statistical fidelity preservation across 30 core fields
94% sustained generator accuracy with adaptive retraining
